# **SIMPLE MERRA-2 PM2.5 HAQAST DATA DOWNLOADER GUI**

## **Overview**
This tool provides an easy-to-use graphical interface (GUI) for downloading PM2.5 satellite data in NetCDF format from **GES DISC**. Users can customize the time period and spatial area of interest, making the data retrieval process more efficient and user-friendly.

## **Features**
- âœ… **Simple GUI-based downloader** for MERRA-2 PM2.5 data  
- âœ… **Customizable time range and spatial selection** for targeted data retrieval  
- âœ… **No need to create your own API access** â€“ making it easier to get the data  
- âœ… **Lightweight and easy to use**  

## **Required Libraries**
- `tkinter` (for GUI)  
- `requests` (for downloading data)  
- `pandas` (for handling metadata)  
- `os` (for file management)  

## **Planned Future Improvements**
- ðŸš€ **Dataset Merging** â€“ Automatically combine downloaded datasets into a single file  
- ðŸ—º **Integrated Spatial Visualization** â€“ Built-in mapping functionality for quick data previews  

## **How to Get the GUI Only**
If you only need the GUI application, you can download the **App** folder from the repository without cloning the entire project. Use the following tool to download a specific folder:
